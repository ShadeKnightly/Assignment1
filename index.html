        "It is time to wake up again into the Dream. 
        
        To shout “fire!” in the theater, 
        not as a hoax, but as a promise. 
        
        To give battle in both worlds at once, and to simply negate our obvious defeat, 
        because the Machine can never dictate the terms of our surrender if the reasons 
        we rebel remain illegible to it. 
        
        Destroying us has always been the last resort of repression, 
        because we are the Machine’s most valuable resource. It has thrived by welding 
        its survival to our own. 
        
        But if we define survival not in material terms but in the continuing of rebellion, 
        in the passing on of a Dream, an Idea, 
        
        then we become the wolf in its flock, 
        
        the sugar in its gas tank, 
        
        and the gremlin in its gears.
        
        ...imagination cannot be taken by force; 
        it can only be surrendered, 
        but at any moment, we can recover it."
